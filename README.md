# 🏢 AI-Powered Commercial Real Estate Assistant

A full-stack, multi-agentic platform designed for the Commercial Real Estate (CRE) sector, combining Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), conversational AI, and intelligent CRM tracking. Originally built as a Python-based RESTful API system, this project has been extended with a modern React frontend to showcase its full capabilities through an intuitive and interactive web interface.

## 🚀 Overview

This system enables real-time, natural language interaction with property data, documents, and CRM intelligence. By integrating OpenAI's GPT-3.5 with a custom RAG pipeline and lightweight CRM, users can perform portfolio analysis, upload and search documents, and revisit prior sessions — all in one place.

## 🔑 What This Project Offers

### 🎯 Core Capabilities

**🤖 Conversational AI with RAG**
- **RAG-Enhanced Responses**: Contextually aware conversations using uploaded documents (PDFs, TXT, CSV, JSON)
- **Persistent Memory**: Full conversation history with session management across user interactions
- **Automatic Tagging**: AI-powered categorization of conversations (Resolved, Inquiring, Portfolio Analysis)
- **Multi-Document Processing**: Semantic search across large document collections using TF-IDF vectorization

**📊 Natural Language Portfolio Analyzer**
- **Smart Query Parsing**: Convert natural language queries into structured database filters
  - *"Show me properties above 15,000 SF with rent below $90/SF"*
  - *"Find high GCI properties above $300,000 on Broadway"*
- **Visual Analytics**: Automatic generation of charts and visualizations for analysis results
- **Export Capabilities**: Download filtered results as CSV files
- **Real-time Statistics**: Portfolio performance metrics and overview dashboards

**👥 Intelligent CRM Integration**
- **User Management**: Automatic user creation and profile management
- **Conversation Logging**: Complete interaction history with timestamps and metadata
- **Session Continuity**: Seamless conversation flow across multiple sessions
- **Smart Categorization**: Automatic tagging based on conversation content and context

**🖼️ React Web Interface (Frontend Showcase)**
While the backend was the primary deliverable, a polished React frontend was developed to demonstrate real-time interactivity. It enables:
- Seamless chat interface with AI
- Document uploads for RAG
- A dedicated portfolio analysis dashboard
- CRM browsing and tagging
- Session history view with reloadable conversations
